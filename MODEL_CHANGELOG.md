# HUMMBL Mental Models Changelog

## 2025-12-18: Phase 1.3 - Core Content Expansion

### Added 5 New Mental Models (SY22-SY26)

#### SY22: Adaptive Complexity Management

- **Definition**: Dynamically adjust system complexity based on current capacity and environmental demands
- **Priority**: 2 (Medium)
- **When to Use**: When managing systems under varying load or complexity
- **Example**: Auto-scaling infrastructure that adds/removes components based on demand

#### SY23: Emergent Behavior Prediction

- **Definition**: Anticipate higher-order behaviors arising from component interactions before they manifest
- **Priority**: 3 (Medium-Low)
- **When to Use**: When designing complex systems with multiple interacting parts
- **Example**: Predicting traffic patterns from individual driver behaviors

#### SY24: System Health Scoring

- **Definition**: Create composite metrics that capture overall system wellness across multiple dimensions
- **Priority**: 2 (Medium)
- **When to Use**: For monitoring and maintaining complex systems
- **Example**: HUMMBL benchmark scoring combining build time, test success, and performance metrics

#### SY25: Cross-System Learning Transfer

- **Definition**: Apply insights and patterns learned in one system to improve performance in related systems
- **Priority**: 3 (Medium-Low)
- **When to Use**: When managing multiple similar systems or scaling solutions
- **Example**: Using debugging patterns from one codebase to prevent issues in another

#### SY26: Meta-System Evolution

- **Definition**: Design systems that can modify their own structure and behavior based on performance feedback
- **Priority**: 4 (Low)
- **When to Use**: For long-term autonomous systems requiring self-improvement
- **Example**: AI systems that modify their own architecture based on task performance

### Framework Statistics

- **Total Models**: 126 (was 121)
- **New Models**: 5
- **Framework Completion**: 105% of original Base120 target
- **Meta-Systems (SY)**: Now 26 models (was 21)

### Validation
