**Note**: DelightModal appears after workflow execution completes. Since execution isn't implemented in MVP, you can test the component directly:

### Manual Test (DevTools Console)

```javascript
// Simulate workflow completion
localStorage.setItem('hummbl_show_delight', 'true');
// Reload page and modal should appear
```

### When Modal Appears

   - [ ] Modal closes
   - [ ] Console shows:
     ```
     [Telemetry] delight_feedback_submitted {
       overall_score: X,
       ease_satisfaction: X,
       visual_satisfaction: X,
       average_score: X.X,
       will_recommend: true/false,
       has_comment: true/false
     }
     ```

4. **Metrics Storage**
   - [ ] Check localStorage: `hummbl_delight_metrics`
