# Mental Models Expansion Progress

## Current Status

**✅ COMPLETE**: 120 out of 120 models (100%)

### Breakdown by Transformation

- **P (Perspective)**: 20/20 ✅ COMPLETE
- **IN (Inversion)**: 20/20 ✅ COMPLETE
- **CO (Composition)**: 20/20 ✅ COMPLETE
- **DE (Decomposition)**: 20/20 ✅ COMPLETE
- **RE (Recursion)**: 20/20 ✅ COMPLETE
- **SY (Systems)**: 20/20 ✅ COMPLETE

## What's Live Now

All 120 mental models are available in the Mental Models browser at `http://localhost:4173/mental-models`.

The complete Base120 framework includes:

- **20 Perspective models** - Fully implemented
- **20 Inversion models** - Fully implemented
- **20 Composition models** - Fully implemented
- **20 Decomposition models** - Fully implemented
- **20 Recursion models** - Fully implemented
- **20 Systems models** - Fully implemented

## Quality Standards Met

All 120 models have been reviewed and meet quality standards:

- ✅ Well-researched and accurate
- ✅ Practical, concrete examples
- ✅ Proper difficulty levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- ✅ Interconnected with related models
- ✅ Appropriately tagged for searchability
- ✅ Consistent formatting and structure
- ✅ Version tracking (1.0-ref)

## Base120 Framework Complete

The HUMMBL Base120 mental model framework is now **100% complete**. All models are:

- Defined with clear, actionable descriptions
- Illustrated with real-world examples
- Cross-referenced with related models
- Organized by transformation type
- Ready for production use

---

## Next Steps

With Base120 complete, you can now:

1. **Deploy to Production** - All 120 models are ready for public use
2. **Build Integrations** - API endpoints can serve the complete model set
3. **Create Documentation** - Generate guides and tutorials using all models
4. **User Testing** - Get feedback on the complete framework
5. **Iterate Based on Feedback** - Refine models based on real-world usage
