# Testing HUMMBL Workflows with Real Outputs

**Date**: November 8, 2025  
**Status**: Production System Live

---

## Problem: Generic Outputs

The test workflow you ran succeeded technically, but produced generic information because **the task inputs were empty**.

When tasks have no context, AI agents give generic "how-to" information instead of actual analysis.

---

## Solution: Add Real Input Data

### Option 1: Simple Content Generation Test

Create a workflow that generates real content:

**Workflow**: "Blog Post Writer"

**Agent 1**: Content Writer (claude-3-haiku-20240307)

- **Task**: "Write Initial Draft"
- **Input**:
  ```json
  {
    "topic": "How Cloudflare Workers enable edge computing",
    "keywords": ["serverless", "edge", "performance", "global"],
    "tone": "technical but accessible",
    "length": "500 words"
  }
  ```

**Agent 2**: Editor (claude-3-haiku-20240307)

- **Task**: "Polish and Improve"
- **Depends on**: Task 1
- **Input**:
  ```json
  {
    "focus": "clarity, technical accuracy, readability"
  }
  ```

**Expected Output**: Actual 500-word blog post about Cloudflare Workers

---

### Option 2: Real Research Analysis

**Workflow**: "Technology Analysis"

**Agent 1**: Research Agent

- **Task**: "Analyze Technology Landscape"
- **Input**:
  ```json
  {
    "topic": "Serverless edge computing platforms in 2025",
    "focus_areas": ["performance", "pricing", "developer experience"],
    "competitors": ["Cloudflare Workers", "Vercel Edge Functions", "AWS Lambda@Edge"]
  }
  ```

**Agent 2**: Analysis Agent

- **Task**: "Compare and Evaluate"
- **Depends on**: Task 1
- **Input**:
  ```json
  {
    "criteria": ["latency", "cost-effectiveness", "ease of use", "scalability"]
  }
  ```

**Agent 3**: Report Generator

- **Task**: "Create Recommendation Report"
- **Depends on**: Task 2
- **Input**:
  ```json
  {
    "format": "executive summary with bullet points",
    "include": ["pros/cons", "use cases", "pricing comparison"]
  }
  ```

**Expected Output**: Detailed comparison report with actionable recommendations

---

### Option 3: Code Analysis (Real Example)

**Workflow**: "React Component Review"

**Agent 1**: Code Analyzer

- **Task**: "Analyze React Component"
- **Input**:
  ```json
  {
    "code": "const Button = ({ onClick, children }) => { return <div onClick={onClick}>{children}</div> }",
    "language": "typescript",
    "framework": "react"
  }
  ```

**Agent 2**: Security Reviewer

- **Task**: "Security Audit"
- **Depends on**: Task 1
- **Input**:
  ```json
  {
    "check_for": ["XSS", "accessibility", "prop validation"]
  }
  ```

**Agent 3**: Quality Checker

- **Task**: "Suggest Improvements"
- **Depends on**: Task 1
- **Input**:
  ```json
  {
    "best_practices": ["semantic HTML", "TypeScript typing", "accessibility"]
  }
  ```

**Expected Output**:

- Issues identified (using div instead of button)
- Security concerns (missing type safety)
- Specific code improvements with examples

## Quick Test: Simple Workflow Creator

### Step-by-Step for Immediate Results

1. **Go to Workflows** → Click "New Workflow"
2. **Name**: "Test: Blog Post Generator"
3. **Add Agent**:
   - Name: "Writer"
   - Model: `claude-3-haiku-20240307`
   - Role: executor
   - Temperature: 0.8

4. **Add Task**:
   - Name: "Write Blog Post"
   - Description: "Create a technical blog post about edge computing"
   - Assign to: Writer
   - **Prompt** (this is key!):

   ```
   Write a 300-word technical blog post about Cloudflare Workers and edge computing.

   Include:
   - What edge computing is
   - Why it's faster than traditional servers
   - One real-world use case
   - A code example (simple)

   Tone: Technical but approachable
   Audience: Web developers
   ```

5. **Save & Run**

**Expected**: A real, usable blog post with code examples

---

## Pro Tip: Use Workflow Input Context

The backend supports passing `input` context to workflows:

```typescript
// In your task definition
{
  "name": "Analyze Data",
  "input": {
    "dataset": "User behavior from Q3 2025",
    "metrics": ["engagement", "retention", "conversion"],
    "timeframe": "July-September 2025"
  }
}
```

The AI agent will receive this as context and generate specific analysis.

---

## Example Prompts That Work Well

### Good ✅

```
Analyze the performance characteristics of Cloudflare Workers D1 database.
Include: cold start times, read/write latency, consistency model.
Compare to: Planetscale, Supabase, Neon.
Output: Table with metrics and recommendations.
```

### Bad ❌

```
Analyze database performance.
```

**Why**: Specific = useful output. Generic = generic output.

## Testing Right Now

Here's what you can do in the next 2 minutes:

1. Go to **Workflows** → **New Workflow**
2. Name: "Quick Test: AI Explainer"
3. Add one agent (claude-3-haiku-20240307)
4. Add one task with this prompt:

   ```
   Explain how the HUMMBL system we just built works, including:
   - The frontend (React + Vite)
   - The backend (Cloudflare Workers + Hono)
   - The database (D1)
   - The AI integration (Anthropic Claude)

   Write it as if explaining to a technical founder.
   Use bullet points and be specific about the architecture.
   ```

5. **Run it**

**You'll get**: A detailed, accurate explanation of your own system!

---

## Summary

**The system works perfectly. You just need to give it specific tasks with real context.**

**Empty inputs → Generic "how-to" responses**  
**Specific inputs → Useful, actionable outputs**

Try the "Quick Test" above right now and you'll see the difference! 🚀
