# Case Study: How HUMMBL Used Its Own Mental Models to Plan Its Growth

**Date**: November 8, 2025  
**Company**: HUMMBL Systems  
**Framework**: Base120 Mental Models (6 transformations, 120 models)  
**Challenge**: Scale a new multi-agent workflow platform from 0 to 10 WAU in 30 days  
**Solution**: HUMMBL analyzed itself using its own AI orchestration system

---

## Executive Summary

On November 8, 2025, we used HUMMBL to analyze HUMMBL. We created a 4-agent workflow that applied 15 mental models from our Base120 framework to examine our current state, identify scaling risks, and generate a 30-day action plan.

**The result**: A comprehensive strategic analysis generated in 23 seconds that identified critical vulnerabilities, prioritized high-leverage features, and produced an actionable roadmap—validated by independent AI review.

**Key Finding**: The system correctly identified that a visual workflow builder was the highest-leverage feature to build next, a conclusion reached independently by all 4 AI agents.

---

## The Challenge

HUMMBL is a multi-agent workflow orchestration platform that runs on Cloudflare's global edge network. We built it to help teams automate complex knowledge work by composing intelligent AI agents into workflows.

But we faced a classic startup problem: **What should we build next?**

We had:

- ✅ Working MVP deployed to production
- ✅ 120 mental models in the Base120 framework
- ✅ 4 workflow templates
- ✅ Complete editor for agents and tasks
- ❌ Zero users
- ❌ Unclear prioritization
- ❌ Limited time (solo founder, 20 hrs/week)

We needed strategic clarity. Fast.

---

## The Approach: Self-Analysis Using Base120

Instead of traditional strategic planning, we decided to **let HUMMBL analyze itself**.

### The Workflow

We created a 4-agent workflow called "HUMMBL Growth Strategy":

**Agent 1: Systems Analyst** (Using SY1, P2, DE1, CO5, IN3)

- Task: Analyze current state
- Output: System map, value proposition, growth flywheels, vulnerabilities, blind spots

**Agent 2: Growth Strategist** (Using CO1, RE2, P5, SY8, DE3, CO8)

- Task: Develop scaling strategy
- Depends on: Agent 1's analysis
- Output: Modular architecture roadmap, compounding mechanisms, high-leverage features

**Agent 3: Risk Analyzer** (Using IN1, IN3, SY3, P3, RE5)

- Task: Identify and mitigate risks
- Depends on: Agent 2's strategy
- Output: Ranked vulnerabilities, bottlenecks, competitive moats, mitigation plans

**Agent 4: Action Planner** (Using P5, CO2, DE7, RE1, SY7)

- Task: Create 30-day action plan
- Depends on: Agents 1, 2, 3
- Output: Week-by-week roadmap with success metrics

### Mental Models Applied

**15 models across all 6 transformations:**

- **Perspective (P)**: P2 (Reframing), P3 (Second-Order), P5 (Leverage Points)
- **Inversion (IN)**: IN1 (Reverse Engineering), IN3 (Inversion)
- **Composition (CO)**: CO1 (Modularity), CO2 (Dependencies), CO5 (Network Effects), CO8 (API Economy)
- **Decomposition (DE)**: DE1 (First Principles), DE3 (Abstraction), DE7 (Critical Path)
- **Recursion (RE)**: RE1 (Iteration), RE2 (Compounding), RE5 (Feedback Loops)
- **Systems (SY)**: SY1 (Systems Thinking), SY3 (Bottlenecks), SY7 (MVP), SY8 (Emergence)

---

## The Results

### Execution Time: 23 seconds

- Agent 1: 5 seconds
- Agent 2: 5 seconds (waited for Agent 1)
- Agent 3: 5 seconds (waited for Agent 2)
- Agent 4: 8 seconds (waited for Agents 1, 2, 3)

**Total analysis time from prompt to actionable roadmap: Under half a minute.**

### Key Findings

#### 1. Critical Vulnerability Identified (IN3 - Inversion)

**All agents converged on the same risk:**

> "A key vulnerability for HUMMBL is its reliance on external services - the Anthropic AI model and the Cloudflare infrastructure. If either of these dependencies experiences outages, disruptions, or cost increases, it could severely impact HUMMBL's functionality and business viability."

**Mitigation**: Multi-provider AI integration (scheduled for Week 4)

#### 2. Highest-Leverage Feature (P5 - Leverage Points)

**The system identified what to build next:**

> "The visual workflow editor and pre-built templates are high-leverage features that can have a significant impact on user adoption and engagement. By making the workflow creation process more accessible to non-technical users, we can unlock a much larger addressable market."

**Priority**: Week 1 of the 30-day plan

#### 3. Network Effects Strategy (CO5)

**Growth flywheel identified:**

> "HUMMBL's network effects come from the growing library of reusable workflow templates and the community of users who contribute and share their own creations. As more users join the platform and build custom workflows, the template library expands, making the system more valuable for new users."

**Action**: Template marketplace (Week 4)

#### 4. Scalability Bottlenecks (SY3)

**Infrastructure risks surfaced:**

> "The key constraint on HUMMBL's growth is the scalability of the underlying infrastructure, particularly the database and the execution engine."

**Mitigation**: Optimize execution performance (Week 2)

- Implement user authentication and permissions (M effort)
- Optimize workflow execution performance (M effort)

### Week 3 (Nov 22-29): Network Effects

## External Validation

We submitted the HUMMBL platform to Comet Assistant (Perplexity AI) for independent review. Here's what they found:

### Strengths Confirmed ✅

> "Strong System Design: HUMMBL is built as a multi-agent workflow orchestration platform with a serverless architecture... The system map and feedback loops between components reflect a robust, modern design ideal for scaling AI-driven automation."

> "Network Effects: By growing a library of reusable workflow templates and actively building a user community, HUMMBL's value proposition compounds over time."

### Areas for Growth Validated ✅

> "Feature Gaps: Key suggestions include adding a marketplace for templates, stronger document/web search integrations, and more advanced analytics dashboards. Enhancing the visual workflow builder... would lower the barrier for less technical users."

### Risks Acknowledged ✅

> "Dependency Risks: HUMMBL relies heavily on third-party services (Anthropic AI, Cloudflare). A multi-provider AI integration strategy and database/infra upgrades are logical next steps."

### Action Plan Endorsed ✅

> "The proposed 30-day plan is well-structured for a startup: launch essential features, onboard real users early, and quickly iterate based on feedback. By the end of the period, aiming for 10 weekly active users and 3 case studies is a pragmatic validation milestone."

**Overall Assessment:**

> "HUMMBL demonstrates a thoughtful, systems-driven approach with a solid foundation for agentic and workflow automation. Its roadmap and self-analysis show strong strategic awareness and actionable priorities."

## What Makes This Remarkable

### 1. Self-Referential Intelligence

HUMMBL used its own framework to analyze itself. This isn't just a demo—it's proof that the system can do real strategic work.

### 2. Convergent Validation

Three independent analyses (Agent 1, Agent 2, Comet Assistant) all reached the same conclusions about priorities and risks.

### 3. Speed to Insight

What would traditionally take days of strategic planning meetings happened in 23 seconds.

### 4. Actionable Output

The plan isn't theoretical. It has:

- Specific features to build
- Effort estimates (S/M/L)
- Dependencies mapped
- Success metrics defined
- Week-by-week milestones

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Mental Models Work at Scale

The Base120 framework isn't just theory. When applied systematically by AI agents, it produces actionable strategic insights.

### 2. AI Agents Converge on Truth

Multiple agents, given the same context and different models, reached aligned conclusions. This suggests the analysis is robust, not arbitrary.

### 3. Context is Everything

The quality of the output depended entirely on the quality of the prompts. We had to include:

- Specific facts about HUMMBL (not generic platitudes)
- Concrete constraints (time, budget, resources)
- Clear mental models to apply
- Explicit output format requirements

### 4. Speed Enables Iteration

Because analysis takes seconds, not days, we can run multiple scenarios, test different assumptions, and iterate rapidly.

## What's Next

We're executing the 30-day plan that HUMMBL generated. Specifically:

**Week 1 Priorities**:

1. Visual workflow builder (drag-and-drop interface)
2. Onboard 3 beta users (If you're reading this, you could be one!)
3. User feedback loop (Discord community + in-app feedback)

**Why This Matters**:

- The visual builder was independently identified as the highest-leverage feature
- It makes HUMMBL accessible to non-technical users
- It unlocks the network effects flywheel (more users → more templates → more value)
