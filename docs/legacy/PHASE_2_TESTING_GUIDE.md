## 🔍 HOW TO CHECK IF DATA IS REAL

### **Real Data Signs** ✅

- Numbers are small or zero (0-100 range)
- Data changes when you interact with app
- Time ranges show different numbers
- Unread count decreases when you mark as read
- Empty states show when no data

### **Fake Data Signs** ❌

- Suspiciously round numbers (exactly 1,000,000)
- Numbers never change
- Perfect percentages (exactly 50%)
- Always shows data even when unused
- Mock names like "Researcher Agent" or "Content Pipeline"

---

## 🐛 DEBUGGING GUIDE

### **If Analytics Page Fails**

**Error**: "Failed to Load Analytics"

**What to check**:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for red errors
3. Check if error says:
   - CORS error → Backend misconfigured
   - 404 error → API endpoint missing
   - 500 error → Database issue
   - Network error → Backend down

**How to fix**:

1. Copy the error message
2. Send to me
3. I'll debug and fix

---

### **If Token Page Shows Empty**

**This is NORMAL if**:

- You haven't executed any workflows
- No API calls have been made
- Brand new installation

**This is a BUG if**:

- You HAVE executed workflows
- Shows error instead of empty state
- Console shows API errors

---

### **If Notifications Don't Update**

**Check**:

1. Click "Mark as Read" on a notification
2. Does the notification change appearance?
3. Does the unread count decrease?
4. If NO → Report the bug

**Expected**:

- Notification background changes
- Blue dot disappears
- Unread count decreases by 1

---

## 💡 TESTING TIPS

1. **Use Incognito Mode** - Fresh state, no cache
2. **Test on Different Browsers** - Chrome, Safari, Firefox
3. **Check Mobile** - Does it work on phone?
4. **Have 2-3 People Test** - Different perspectives
5. **Take Screenshots** - Document any bugs
6. **Note Console Errors** - F12 → Console → Screenshot errors

## 📊 CURRENT PROGRESS

**Hours Spent**: 4h  
**Features Built**: 3/11 pages  
**Completion**: ~25%  
**Remaining**: 15-20h estimated

**Built**:

- ✅ Analytics Dashboard (real data)
- ✅ Token Usage (real data)
- ✅ Notifications (real data)

**Not Built Yet**:

- ⏸️ API Keys (Phase 2.3)
- ⏸️ Team Management (Phase 3)
- ⏸️ Execution Monitor (Phase 1.2)
- ⏸️ Error Logs (Phase 1.3)
- ⏸️ Advanced features

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

**My honest take**:

1. **Test for 15-30 minutes**
2. **Get 2-3 people to try it**
3. **Document any bugs**
4. **Make decision**:
   - No bugs → Continue building
   - Minor bugs → Fix then continue
   - Major bugs → Stop and debug

**Don't over-test**:

- This is still a work-in-progress
- Some features missing is expected
- Goal is to verify the 3 built features work

**Focus on**:

- Does it crash?
- Is data real or fake?
- Do buttons work?
- Any console errors?
