### Step 2: Validate Metrics

**Open DevTools** (F12 or Cmd+Opt+I)

#### Check localStorage

1. Go to: **Application** tab → **Storage** → **Local Storage** → `https://hummbl.vercel.app`

2. **Verify Keys Exist**:

   ```
   workflows
   agents
   tasks
   hummbl_delight_metrics (if DelightModal triggered)
   ```

3. **Inspect Workflow Data**:
   - Click `workflows` key
   - Should show JSON with your workflow
   - Verify: name, description, agents, tasks present

#### Check Console Telemetry

1. Go to: **Console** tab
2. Filter by: `[Telemetry]`

3. **Expected Events**:

   ```
   [Telemetry] visual_builder_opened
   [Telemetry] agent_added
   [Telemetry] task_added
   [Telemetry] connection_created
   [Telemetry] workflow_created
   [Telemetry] ttfw_achieved
   ```

4. **Capture TTFW Event**:
   ```json
   {
     time_to_first_win_seconds: XX,
     time_to_first_win_formatted: "X:XX"
   }
   ```

---

### Step 3: Capture Proof

**Screenshot Checklist**:

- [ ] Dashboard with saved workflow visible
- [ ] Workflow editor showing connected nodes
- [ ] DevTools localStorage with workflow data
- [ ] Console showing telemetry events
- [ ] TTFW timestamp

**Paste Results**:

```
LIVE URL: https://hummbl.vercel.app
TTFW: ___ seconds (Target: ≤120s)
Workflow Saved: YES / NO
Agent Connected: YES / NO
Telemetry Logged: YES / NO
Delight Score: N/A (manual workflow, no completion event)
```

---

### Step 4: Feature Validation

**Test Each Feature**:

- [ ] **Dashboard loads** (<3 seconds)
- [ ] **New Workflow button** works
- [ ] **Agent presets** all 5 visible and clickable
- [ ] **Visual canvas** renders nodes
- [ ] **Drag-and-drop** creates edges
- [ ] **Text mode toggle** preserves data
- [ ] **Save workflow** persists to localStorage
- [ ] **Workflow list** shows saved workflow
- [ ] **Edit workflow** loads existing data
- [ ] **Minimap** visible and interactive
- [ ] **Zoom controls** work (+/-)
- [ ] **No console errors** (except known warnings)
