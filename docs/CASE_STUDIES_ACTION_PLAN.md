# Case Studies Action Plan

**Date**: 2025-12-06  
**Status**: Ready to Begin

## Current Status

### Case Study 1: Multi-Service AI Recommendation System ✅ READY

- **Brief**: ✅ Complete (`hummbl-research/docs/case-study1-multi-service-ai-brief.md`)
- **Operator Sequence**: ✅ Defined (10 models: P02 → DE07 → DE06 → DE08 → CO03 → CO12 → RE06 → SY04 → SY01 → SY19)
- **Target Date**: Dec 31, 2025 (or Jan 15, 2026 per some docs)
- **Status**: Ready to record
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Review brief and operator sequence
  2. Prepare architecture diagram (if not already done)
  3. Schedule recording session (20-40 min)
  4. Record video following operator sequence
  5. Extract written case study from video
  6. Publish to hummbl.io
  7. Create social media thread

### Case Study 2: Fitness Transformation ⏳ NEEDS BRIEF

- **Status**: Planning
- **Target Date**: Dec 31, 2025
- **Needs**:
  - [ ] Finalize use case and problem statement
  - [ ] Create brief document
  - [ ] Define operator sequence
  - [ ] Schedule recording session
  - [ ] Record video
  - [ ] Extract written case study
  - [ ] Publish

### Case Study 3: Ozzy Health Protocol ⏳ NEEDS VET APPOINTMENT

- **Status**: Preparation
- **Target Date**: Dec 15, 2025
- **Needs**:
  - [ ] Schedule vet appointment
  - [ ] Complete pre-vet preparation
  - [ ] Conduct vet visit
  - [ ] Create brief document
  - [ ] Define operator sequence
  - [ ] Record video
  - [ ] Extract written case study
  - [ ] Publish

## Recommended Order

1. **Start with Case Study 1** (most prepared)
2. **Then Case Study 3** (if vet appointment can be scheduled soon)
3. **Finally Case Study 2** (needs more planning)

## Case Study 1 - Ready to Record Checklist

### Pre-Recording

- [ ] Review brief: `hummbl-research/docs/case-study1-multi-service-ai-brief.md`
- [ ] Review operator sequence (10 models)
- [ ] Prepare architecture diagram (if needed)
- [ ] Set up screen recording software
- [ ] Test recording setup

### During Recording

- [ ] Follow operator sequence from brief
- [ ] Show problem brief on screen
- [ ] Apply each model in sequence
- [ ] Document outputs (lists, diagrams, decisions)
- [ ] Capture artifacts (diagrams, notes)
- [ ] Keep to 20-40 minutes

### Post-Recording

- [ ] Extract written case study using template
- [ ] Create annotated diagrams
- [ ] Document intervention list
- [ ] Write reflection section
- [ ] Publish to `docs/case-studies/case-study1-multi-service-ai.md`
- [ ] Add to CaseStudiesPage component
- [ ] Create social media thread
- [ ] Update checklist

## Resources

- **Template**: `docs/case-study-template.md`
- **Brief**: `hummbl-research/docs/case-study1-multi-service-ai-brief.md`
- **Operator Sequence**: Defined in brief (Section 3)
- **SY19 Tool**: Available for model recommendations (`tools/sy19_recommend.py`)

## Questions to Answer Before Recording

1. **Case Study 1**:
   - Do you have a real multi-service AI system to analyze, or will this be a hypothetical/example?
   - Do you have architecture diagrams ready?
   - Do you have logs/metrics to reference?

2. **Case Study 3**:
   - When can you schedule the vet appointment?
   - What's the health issue/protocol you're designing?

3. **Case Study 2**:
   - What's the fitness transformation scenario?
   - Personal transformation or designing a program for someone else?
